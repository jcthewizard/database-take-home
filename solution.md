### Approach & Analysis

I began by analyzing challenge through a systematic, data-driven approach. Here's my step-by-step analysis process:

First, I ran the initial random graph through the evaluation script to establish a baseline, Here, I discovered an 80.0% success rate with 526-step median path length

Second, I loaded the query results and analyzed the distribution of target nodes.
I used Python's Counter class to identify query frequencies and found that only 37 out of 500 nodes are ever queried.

I then found that 1022 edges (exceeding the 1000 limit) has mostly low weights (0.1-1.0).
Many nodes had minimal edges despite the high total count which revealed inefficient resource allocation.

More important findings:
- Calculated query concentration: ~63% target nodes 0-9, ~36% target nodes 10-49
- Identified 26 "high-value targets" (queried ≥2 times)
- Realized: 463 nodes (92.6%) are never queried, making them essentially irrelevant

The most obvious approach without constraints would be to create direct connections from every node to every target (18,500 edges needed). This would achieve theoretical minimum: 1-step paths for all queries. My first approach was to implement a hub-and-spoke architecture with dense interconnections. However, this required 1,500-2,000+ edges, far exceeding our 1000 edge limit.

The extreme skew in query patterns revealed that we could dramatically improve performance by optimizing the graph structure specifically for the 37 frequently queried nodes (0-43), rather than trying to maintain uniform connectivity across all 500 nodes. This insight led to testing the ring architecture approach.

### Optimization Strategy

Based on my analysis, I designed a three-tier ring architecture that optimizes for the actual query workload while respecting all system constraints. Here is the high-level approach: Instead of trying to optimize all 500 nodes, focus on the 37 that are actually queried.

**Tier 1: Inner Ring (Nodes 0-9)
- **Purpose**: Handle 63% of all queries (most popular targets)
- **Strategy**: Linear progression 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10
- **Weights**: Maximum weight (10.0) for predictable, fast routing
- **Result**: Queries to nodes 0-9 find their target in ~5 steps

**Tier 2: Medium Ring (Nodes 10-49)
- **Purpose**: Handle 36% of queries (medium popularity targets)
- **Strategy**: Three-edge system per node for optimal connectivity
  - **Primary Path**: Sequential progression (weight 10.0)
  - **Skip Connection**: Jump +3 nodes ahead (weight 8.0) for faster traversal
  - **Backup Route**: Low-weight connection to node 0 (weight 1.0) as safety net
- **Result**: Queries to nodes 10-49 find their target efficiently

**Tier 3: Direct Redirection (Nodes 50-499)
- **Purpose**: Handle the 90% of nodes that are never queried
- **Strategy**: Every unused node points directly to node 0 with maximum weight (10.0)
- **Result**: If a query somehow reaches these nodes, it instantly gets redirected to the most popular target

**Weight Hierarchy System**
- **10.0**: Primary paths and most important connections
- **8.0**: Secondary paths and skip connections
- **1.0**: Backup routes (rarely used but provide safety)
- This creates clear path preferences for the random walk algorithm

### Implementation Details

I used a simple adjacency list. I initially tried using integers for node IDs, but JSON serialization was easier with strings, so I stuck with "0", "1", "2" etc. For weights, I picked fixed values (10.0, 8.0, 1.0).

I experimented with different weight combinations (including randomization) and found that having a clear hierarchy works best:
- **10.0**: Main paths that should be taken most of the time
- **8.0**: Secondary options that are good but not the best
- **1.0**: Backup routes that are there if needed but rarely used
- **9.0**: Special case for the loopback from node 49 to 0

The +3 skip distance in the medium ring was a bit of trial and error. I tried +2, +4, and even +5, but +3 gave the best balance. Using only 579 out of 1000 possible edges actually helps performance - fewer edges means less confusion for the random walk algorithm. Every node has at least one outgoing edge, so there are no dead ends.

### Results

**Final Performance Metrics:**
- **Success Rate**: 100.0%
- **Median Path Length**: 8.0 steps
- **Combined Score**: 523.18
- **Edge Utilization**: 579/1000 edges

### Trade-offs & Limitations

**Ring Architecture Trade-offs (Current Solution):**

Strenghts:
- Fixed weights and simple structure ensure consistent results

Limitations:
- If the query distribution changes dramatically, performance could degrade
- The three-tier approach doesn't adapt to different graph topologies

**Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Trade-offs (First Attempt):**

Limitations:
- Too many high-weight paths competing for random walk attention
- Exceeded edge limits and node degree constraints


My complex hub-and-spoke approach failed because it tried to optimize too many things at once. The ring architecture succeeds because it focuses on one thing: creating clear, predictable paths to the most important targets.

### Iteration Journey

My optimization journey spanned multiple iterations, each building on insights from the previous attempts.

**Iteration 1: Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
- **Approach**: Created 15 hub nodes with dense interconnections, connecting high-value targets to hubs
- **Results**: Success rate dropped to 48.5%, path length improved to 282.5 steps
- **Key Learning**: Complex hub systems create path confusion and break existing connectivity
- **Data Insight**: The evaluation showed that adding complexity actually degraded performance
- **Why It Failed**: Too many high-weight paths competing for random walk attention

**Iteration 2: Conservative Weight Optimization
- **Approach**: Started with initial graph structure, increased edge weights for high-value targets (4x for top 5, 3x for top 10)
- **Results**: Success rate maintained at 80%, path length increased to 550
- **Key Learning**: Preserving existing connectivity is crucial for success rate
- **Data Insight**: Weight optimization alone wasn't sufficient for path length improvement

**Iteration 3: Ring Architecture Discovery
- **Results**: Success rate 100%, path length 8.0 steps, score 520.10
- **Key Learning**: Simple linear progression beats complex interconnections
- **Data Insight**: The 57.9% edge utilization (579/1000) was actually optimal from my experimentation

**Iteration 5: Fine-Tuning and Validation
- **Approach**: Systematically tested skip distances (+2, +3, +4), strategic shortcuts, and weight distributions
- **Results**: +3 skip distance proved optimal, shortcuts degraded performance, exact weights provided consistency
- **Key Learning**: More connections ≠ better performance; sparsity improves path guidance
